The loading component is used as a progress-bar for indicating progress and activity as seen below

```html
<h4>Medium load indicator</h4>
<sbb-loading mode="medium" aria-valuetext="Loading 3 please wait"></sbb-loading>
```

The loading indicator supports four modes for inline usage (tiny, small, medium (default), big)
and also a mode for covering the parent element (fullbox) and the full screen (fullscreen).
